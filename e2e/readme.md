# Cypress tests to validate the API

## Setup

1. Make sure your console is in the root folder for these tests:  `cd e2e`   
2. Run `npm ci` to ensure the exact same npm packages are installed that are installed on my working version



## Running the tests

Run in console: `npm run cy:run`     
Run in browser (useful for troubleshooting): `npm run cy:open`
